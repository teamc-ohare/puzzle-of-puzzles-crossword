          Puzzle of Puzzles is a hybrid type puzzle, consisting of both a logical and hidden object game, offering a 
		  series of related word puzzles, requiring the player to solve logic puzzles, testing many problem-solving 
		  skills including logic, pattern recognition, sequence solving, spatial recognition and word completion, 
		  based upon a single theme. Players must unravel a series of puzzles to advance to the next level, which in 
		  turn, leads to a more difficult challenge.
		  
		  The hybrid puzzle is themed structured, revolveing around O'Hare International Airport, providing an 
		  entertaining educational puzzle game, focused on the cultural and cosmopolitan experience of leisurely 
		  travel, where you're able to learn fun filled facts about O'Hare International Airport. The game provides 
		  four different difficulty levels: Easy, Intermediate, Normal and Advanced; consisting of a number of long 
		  and short entries within a grid, featuring solid areas of white squares, and shaded squares, where a random 
		  puzzle will generate with clues, based upon specific areas within the airport, specific history about the 
		  airport, or specific aviation technologies. 
		  
		  Every letter is checked, either as part of both an Across answer or a Down answer, and each answer must 
		  contain at least three letters. Clues are given, separated into an Across list and Down list. The grids are 
		  also based upon a 180-degree rotational symmetry, so that its pattern appears the same if turned upside 
		  down. The puzzles appear in one of several standard sizes based upon the chosen difficulty level by the 
		  player, ranging from 6x6 to 15x15 grids. Along with themed images when a puzzle is completed, backstories 
		  if progressing between puzzle levels, and a chance to be FEATURED if the hidden word puzzle is unlocked and
		  completed without exiting the game.
