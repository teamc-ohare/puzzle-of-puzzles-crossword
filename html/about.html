          O'Hare Crossword Puzzle's is a hybrid type puzzle game, developed by Joshua Kidder of DeVry University's
          September 2020 Team C, O'Hare IT-gaming Intern Project, consisting of both logical and hidden object games, 
          offering a series of related word puzzles, requiring the player to solve logic puzzles, testing many 
          problem-solving skills including logic, pattern recognition, sequence solving, spatial recognition and 
          word completion, based upon a single theme. Players must unravel a series of puzzles to advance to 
          the next level, which in turn, leads to a more difficult challenge.
          <br><br>
		      The hybrid puzzle is themed structured, revolving around O'Hare International Airport, providing an 
		      entertaining educational puzzle game, focused on the cultural and cosmopolitan experience of 
          leisurely travel, where you're able to learn fun filled facts about O'Hare International Airport. 
          <br><br>
          The game provides four different difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Normal and Advanced; 
          consisting of a number of long and short entries within a grid, featuring solid areas of white 
          squares, and shaded squares, where a random puzzle will generate with clues, based upon specific 
          areas within the airport, specific history about the airport, or specific aviation technologies. 
          <br><br>
		      Every letter is checked, either as part of both an Across answer or a Down answer, and each answer 
          must contain at least three letters. Clues are given, separated into an Across list and Down list. 
          The grids are also based upon a 180-degree rotational symmetry, so that its pattern appears the same 
          if turned upside down. The puzzles appear in one of several standard sizes based upon the chosen 
          difficulty level by the player, ranging from 5x5 to 15x15 grids. Along with themed images when a 
          puzzle is completed, backstories if progressing between puzzle levels, and a chance to be FEATURED 
          if the hidden word puzzle is unlocked and completed without exiting the game.
