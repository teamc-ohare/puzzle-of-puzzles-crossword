# Puzzle of Puzzles [prototype]

Puzzle of Puzzles is a themed hybrid crossword puzzle, consisting of a logical and hidden object type puzzle game, containing a number of long and short entries within an auto-populated grid. Upon entering the chosen difficulty level an auto-populated grid will appear, ranging from a 6x6 to 15x5 grid, depending upon the game difficulty, along with a clue list for that specific puzzle. The puzzle game is randomly selected out of the games for that specified difficulty level. Based upon the Across list and Down list, you will attempt to solve the word puzzle. Each letter entered, is checked against the correct answer. When a tile is entered, the validator will be triggered, turning the tile yellow. If the correct letter is given, the tile will turn green. If the letter is incorrect, the tile will remain white.
